			Who We Are
		</h2>
		<p class="mb-4 text-steel-200 leading-relaxed">
			Serenity Engine is a small, independent studio dedicated to crafting digital experiences that
			feel different from the noise of the modern web. We believe technology can serve contemplation
			rather than distraction.
		</p>
		<p class="text-steel-300 leading-relaxed">
			Founded with the conviction that the internet deserves more spaces built with care, intention,
			and a reverence for the people who inhabit them.

			What We Build
		</h2>
		<p class="mb-4 text-steel-200 leading-relaxed">
			We build unique online spaces — applications, tools, and experiences that prioritize depth over
			breadth, quality over quantity, and meaning over metrics.
		</p>
		<p class="text-steel-300 leading-relaxed">
			Every project starts with a question: <em class="text-gold-100">what would this feel like if
			someone actually cared?</em> From there, we work with modern technologies — real-time 3D,
			immersive audio, and thoughtful interaction design — to build something worth spending time with.

			Our Approach
		</h2>
		<p class="mb-4 text-steel-200 leading-relaxed">
			We work slowly and deliberately. No sprints, no growth hacking, no engagement traps. Each
			project is given the time it needs to become what it should be.
		</p>
		<p class="text-steel-300 leading-relaxed">
			The aesthetic is intentional — warm golds against void blacks, contemplative pacing, interfaces
			that breathe. We draw inspiration from architecture, film, and the quiet spaces between things.
